# CSharpExamples
My Attempt at learning C# using the book C# 7.0 in a nutshell. Examples of concepts based on code from C# 7.0 in a nutshell or my own examples of concepts taught in the book. Or examples of anything I have tried to teach myself.

You will find code from the book C# 7.0 in a Nutshell (O'Reilly by Joseoh and Ben Albahri) as written, extended by me, strictly by me, etc. This is just my attempt at learning C#. I am not sure where this will go. I will accept useful pull requests such as bug fixes or additional examples of a concept.

All examples with page numbers are from or based on code samples from:
C# 7.0 in a Nutshell (O'Reilly by Joseoh and Ben Albahri 2017)
